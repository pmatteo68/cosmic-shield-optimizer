# cosmic-shield-optimizer
Python optimization engine, based on scikit-optimize (https://scikit-optimize.github.io/) that iteratively runs a cosmic shield simulator (ref. my other repository, 'cosmic-shield-simulator') to identify shielding configurations meeting defined energy, protection efficiency, and constraint criteria.
